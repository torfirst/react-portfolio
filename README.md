## Credits

Referenced class activities. Referenced Formik documentation, specifically [this page](https://formik.org/docs/examples/instant-feedback). Spent too much time looking into react-pdf before finding [this cruder but sufficient solution](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45596329/display-pdf-in-reactjs).

Received immensely valuable guidance from TA/BCS tutor Erik Hirsch.
